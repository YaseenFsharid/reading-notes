# HMTL links and layouts

**links are used to connect our pages togother**
_Links are the defining feature of the web_
_because they allow you to move from_
_one web page to another â€” enabling the_
_very idea of browsing or surfing._

##### html link tag is < a > < /a>
**link this < a href = "https:google.com ">google< /a>**
we can with links do the whole types of linking 
between the code in the same place , pages ,to the web any place i want to get .

##### layouts
 1. _Key concepts in positioning elements_
 2. _Building Blocks CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box._ 
 3. + Block-level elements start on a new line such as :
    + < i > < p > < ul > < li > etc.. **are block level elements**
    + Inline elements flow in between surrounding text :
    + < img> < b> < i>
    + A box may be nested inside
      several other block-level
      elements. The containing
      element is always the direct
      parent of that element.   
4. CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to  
       control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning,and absolute positioning.     
5. Normal Flow position:static
6. Relative Positioning position:relative
7. Absolute Positioning position:absolute
8. Fixed Positioning position:fixed
9. Overlapping Elements z-index
10. Using Float to Place Elements Side-by-Side.
  + float :right ;
  + float :left ;
11. creating muli-colomn-layouts with float  width
This sets the width of the
columns.
float
This positions the columns next
to each other.
margin
This creates a gap between the
columns. 

## Functions methods and objects 

**Function :** _let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task._
there is defferant types for creating functions
1. _functions inside variable created function will asigned to values_
2. _seprated function created function can used here by direct calling it name_
   +function call is like that name( ); function name and circle braketes

#### Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
**some resones to make pair programming**
+ helps team work and reduce time consuming to edit the code 
+ allow two programmers see the code at the same time .
+ allow two programmers to switching rules to each others code.
+ allow two programmers to share thier coding capaility with each other
+ A system with two programmers possesses greater potential for the generation of more diverse solutions to problems for three reasons:
 1. the programmers bring different prior experiences to the task;
 2. they may assess information relevant to the task in different ways;
 3. they stand in different relationships to the problem by virtue of their functional roles.
