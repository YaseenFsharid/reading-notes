## CSS ( cascading style sheets  )

**What css does ?**
_css dose the way to styling our web pages and make our content look fabulous for whole of tages that used to create our content from texting ,imaging , menues etc .._

_CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented virtual box that surrounded each element in the tags_

**How css works**
_CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration._

+ As like this 
+ p { " p with these pharantises used to select the elements wants to style" 
+ color : blue ; adding color to p 
+ }

**Rules ,proparities and values**

**the above example is representing rule in css**

**CSS contains too many proparities in css like background-color , color, font- family etc .**

**CSS has three defferant types of creation**
 + **inline style : putting style tag into elemnt thats you want to style** _< p style = "font-family :seirf" >  like this_
 + **embedded style : putting the syle opening and closing tag in the head the then select the elements inside it** _< style > p { color : blue } < / style >_
 + **external style : putting the css rules into separates style.css file and then link them to html file like** _< link  rel : "stylesheets" type = " text/css " href = "the place of  the css file ">_

   + _for ( var counter = 0; counter < = 10 ; i ++ ){_
   + _repeating stamtents until the condition is false_
   + _}_
