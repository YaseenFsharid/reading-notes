# HTML list and boxes 
## Lists
**we have three defferant types of lists**

**There are lots of occasions when we**
**need to use lists.** 
_HTML provides us with_
_three different types:_
+ Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.
_ordered list made by < ol > < li> tags_
+ Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
+ Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.
**ordered  list**
 1. < ol >
 2. < li> cats < /li>
 3. < li> dogs < /li>
 4. < /ol>
 _here it will appears an ordered list have to item 1-cat 2-dog_
 **unordered list**
 + < ul>
 + < li> cats < /li>
 + < li> dogs< /li>
 + < /ol>
  _here it will make an unordered list with tow items cats and dogs with a sgin beside the left side of each item_

  **defention list**
  here it will makes a defention list with dl dt dd tags 
  dl meant _data list_ dt _data term_ dd _data defenetion_
  and we use it if we have to define someting
   1. < dl >
   2. < dt> cats < /lt>
   3. < dd> someting have four legs  < /li>
   4. < /dl>
   _here it will apear in cats and the defention under it_

   ## Boxes
   
   1. **html have a boxes control we can call the box container of elements or element**

   2. **and we can handle width and the height inside boxes using paddings and margins the paddings controle the box inside the elemets and the margins contorls outside that box**

  
  ## switch statment
 A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.
Each case indicates a possible
value for this variable and the
code that should run if the
variable matches that value

## IF ... ELSE
+ There is no need to provide an el se
option. (You can just use an if
statement.)
+ With a series of if statements, they are
all checked even if a match has been found
(so it performs more slowly than switch).

vs

## SWITCH
+ You have a default option that is run if
none of the cases match.
+ If a match is found, that code is run; then
the break statement stops the rest of
the switch statement running (providing
better performance than multiple i f
statements).
