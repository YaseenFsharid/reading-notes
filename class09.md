# Forms 
### form control 
_there is several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitor to your site some of these :_
+ text input sigle line 
+ text input multiline
+ password input

**The forms work like this:** 
+ A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.
+ The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.
+ The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database.
+ The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.

_every form has action and method:_
1. the action : its value the url for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted. 
2. method :Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post. With the get method, the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute.
+ we using get when we just for short term input and when we retreaving data from server
+ we using post allows the users to uplode data , its too long , contains sensitve data , add or delet inforamtion from database

**new html5 inputs like : email and url**

+ on the same tag input 
+ or take the id form the input and making the eventListener on javaScript code .
